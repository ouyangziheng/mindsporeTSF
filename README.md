# SparseTSF - MindSpore Implementation
This repository is an unofficial MindSpore implementation of the [SparseTSF](https://github.com/lss-1138/SparseTSF)  project based on , 
originally developed using PyTorch. The goal of this project is to provide an efficient framework for time-series forecasting with sparse data. 
In this version, the implementation has been translated from PyTorch to MindSpore for enhanced performance and compatibility with the MindSpore ecosystem.

## Features
Sparse Time-Series Forecasting: This project aims to provide a solution for forecasting sparse time-series data.
MindSpore Implementation: The entire model is now implemented using MindSpore, a powerful deep learning framework designed for high-performance computing on a variety of hardware.
Pre-trained Models: The repository includes pre-trained models that are ready for fine-tuning or use in your own applications.

## Acknowledgements
This implementation is based on the original work done in the PyTorch-based SparseTSF repository. Many thanks to the authors for their contributions.
